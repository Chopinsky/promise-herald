# promise-herald

A nimble npm package that dispatch the resolvement or rejection of a promise to 
many subscribers, regardless of when they decide to listen to the promise.

This package can also help create an immutable data dispatcher, where the source
can only be retrieved in their pristine state, and not modified.
